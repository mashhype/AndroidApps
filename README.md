Two basic games here: 

1. Shapes Matching game - This game demonstrates how to use touch events and the android graphics library, 
The game works as follows:
Initialize shapes on a grid  that you can move from one cell to another.  Shapes swap positions when shape x intersects shape y.  Clicking in the grid but not on the shape shuffles the shapes.  Clicking on a shape highlights all of the shapes that are the same.  

2. Falling Blocks game - This game demonstrates how you can tie the values coming out of the accelerometer 
and magnetometer to control BitmapDrawables and ShapeDrawables on the screen.  The purpose of the game is to keep
the Mario icon from falling to the bottom.  If he hits the bottom of the screen, the game is over.  If he collides with 
a falling block, then his movement is suspended until he is able to move away from the blocks.
